## Education

-   This feature represents the highest level of education attained by each entity.

-   Measurement : Categorical

-   Data Type: Factor

```{r echo=TRUE}
    unique(data$education)
```

## Summary

-   The first step in Preparing this feature was to observe the data.

-   <div>

    ```{r echo=TRUE}
    summary(data$education)
    ```

    </div>

### Education Cleaning - Handling Missing Data

The decision was made to derive the missing data based on information deduced from our data-set.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
    avg_balance <- data %>%
      filter(education != "") %>%
      group_by(education) %>%
      summarize(avg_balance = mean(balance, na.rm = TRUE))

    colors <- c("blue", "green", "grey")
    plot <- plot_ly(data = avg_balance, x = ~education, y = ~avg_balance, type = "bar",
                    marker = list(color = colors),
                    hovertemplate = paste("Education: %{x}<br>",
                                          "Average Balance: %{y}"))

    layout <- list(title = "Average Balance by Education",
                   xaxis = list(title = "Education"),
                   yaxis = list(title = "Average Balance"))

    plot <- plot %>% layout(layout)

    #plot
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
avg_balance <- data %>%
  filter(education != "") %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarize(avg_balance = mean(balance, na.rm = TRUE))

#attach(avg_balance)

tempdf <- data %>%
  mutate(
    tertiary_diff = abs(balance - avg_balance$avg_balance[3]),
    secondary_diff = abs(balance - avg_balance$avg_balance[2]),
    primary_diff = abs(balance - avg_balance$avg_balance[1])
  )

```

```{r echo=TRUE}
tempdf <- tempdf %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    education = if_else( education == "",
      if_else(
        tertiary_diff <= secondary_diff & tertiary_diff <= primary_diff,
        "tertiary",
        if_else(
          secondary_diff <= primary_diff, "secondary", "primary")
      ),education
    )
    )
data$education <- as.factor(tempdf$education)

summary(data$education)

```
